1,y'all need to be fucked up to not order from chinese and other asian restaurants bc of your fear of the corona virus because they're of the few spots that are open at like 2 am for YOUR white annoying high ass ... ok goodbye .....
1,for the last fucking time.... CORONAVIRUS IS NO EXCUSE TO BE RACIST AGAINST ASIANS https://t.co/nBHTadCKzK
1,"A hospital was built in Wuhan China in 10 days to accommodate #CoronaVirus patients. In Kenya we are leaving our people Scott free to interact with people from China on a daily basis without care. When the disease will strike, it will then Dawn to as that truly Karma is a bitch.."
1,My doctor told me there?€?s 4% chance of you dying of coronavirus and 10% chance of you dying from the flu. If the media reports every time someone has the flu then the numbers will be far more. Fucking tired of this unnecessary mass hysteria and even worse racism towards Chinese???????
1,White Racists: Don?€?t eat Chinese food! It might have coronavirus! &gt;My family eating Chinese food peacefully Me: Well at least the lines are shorter and we can order the special items. My Dad: These idiots think we?€?ll get a virus from eating Chinese food.
1,Then you?€?re gonna call corona virus a ?€?Ching Chong disease?€? get the fuck out of my face. And when someone calls you out you wanna act like the victim? Y?€?all fuckin suck and I?€?m tired of it
1,"@Rjay_H I?€?m not sure I?€?d go that far, if we consider 2019 Coronavirus a bioweapon then so is the flu of 2019-2020 as well. The flu has already killed more people and is killing them faster than COVID-19"
1,yes we fucking do know it's not a bioweapon you morons
1,Pleasant ???? #racism #excuses   ?€?Coronavirus chink?€?: Racist man hospitalises woman for defending her Chinese female friend in Birmingham https://t.co/VEfrk3JJ98 via @ResonateVoices
1,Aren?€?t there laws against broadcasting false information over the air? The coronavirus IS NOT: - The common cold - A bioweapon from a Chinese lab - A communist plot No matter what certain right-wing radio hosts might think.  https://t.co/kTM4owMSPi
1,@SykesCharlie Well I read that pile of crap and he also expounds on how it was probably an escaped Chinese bioweapon and how fentanyl is not really dangerous if you inhale just a little of the dust. His coronavirus claims aren?€?t even close to being the most idiotic thing in there.
1,"Why the fuck would they rescind the 1 child policy, in a bid to grow their economy by growing their population (something capitalism demands), only to secretly develop a bioweapon to control the population?   That makes no sense you fucking idiot."
1,I would especially urge my fellow Jewish friends in the US to patronise their local Chinese restaurants/takeouts EXTRA atm. American Jews have a historic special bond with American Chinese food places. We need to help counteract this racist &amp; ignorant paranoia re: coronavirus
1,For the last...damn...time.. the flu and the measles are what is killing Americans not the coronavirus ???? take your xenophobia somewhere else and GET YOUR FLU SHOT! WASH YOUR DAMN HANDS AND COVER YOUR MOUTH ???? https://t.co/6V6wTVoMLg
1,"Literally like, someone I know fucking laughed when a Chinese man got beat up because of the Coronavirus.   LAUGHED. That's disgraceful"
1,CW racism  Concept: let's not draw racist personifications of viruses that kill thousands and then make xenophobic comments in the description abt the diets of people in the east
1,"We can't believe this has to be a hot take right now.  Did we sleep deprive ourselves little too much? Was staying up until 2:30AM last night reading The Devil's A Part-Timer a mistake?  Anyways: eating Chinese food isn't going to fucking give you the coronavirus, damn racists."
1,I was just called a racist for saying I?€?d rather lick handrails in China than vote for Bernie. Because... coronavirus is now ?€?racist?€? ????
1,"Jews, pretend it?€?s Christmas and head to your favorite local Chinese food place. Order a lot. Standing with our local Chinese business owners is a delicious mitzvah."
1,You must be the dumbest idiot I've ever seen. Because it's not only in China dumbass. Get your head out of your ass and read some news.
1,"Because of the decline in business at Chinese restaurants because of Coronavirus-amplified racism, Mandy and I are gonna feast on a bunch of Chinese takeout today."
1,Atleast China knows how to take care of their citizens and builds WHOLE NEW HOSPITALS for them. They?€?ll walk away healed from this virus but if America gets it we?€?re all fucked bc our health care system sucks
1,"Damn, and I?€?m having Chinese food tomorrow so they?€?ll be getting my business! Suck on that, racist assholes! Y?€?all will never take me away from lo mein and sweet and sour chicken bitches!!"
1,Don't panic China will send them a shit load of ducks!
1,"I hate stereotypes, poc AREN?€?T  criminals, white people aren?€?t ALL dirty, and people who are Asian or a part of the Asian culture do not have the fucking coronavirus... It?€?s 2020 and we still all have to have these discussions. You will never see me discriminate against someone."
1,"I was chatting with my partners mum, who is a midwife, completely perplexed as to where to put a prospective Coronavirus patient, with no quarantined section in the hospital. China built a hospital in 6 days. In conclusion, WHERE THE FUCK is Nick Knowles when you need him."

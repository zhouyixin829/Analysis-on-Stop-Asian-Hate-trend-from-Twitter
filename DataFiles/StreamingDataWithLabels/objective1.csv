,@MrAndyNgo But but every commercial on @Disney and @Nickelodeon go on and on insinuating that some other race is responsible for #asianhate ! I dont get it ?
,@MrAndyNgo I have noticed that the media aren't talking about #stopasianhate anymore now that so many of these attacks have been caught on camera.  The evidence doesn't fit the media narrative
,@MrAndyNgo We are witnessing the evil hand of liberal leadership organizing this kind of thing.  #stopasianhate is a cue for the ever used black plantation workers to go and attack Asians.

1,I find the hate for #asians in US is unfounded. #stopasianhate because you need to be educated how the virus came about. The outbreak in Wuhan has been contained but u guys r still struggling. What if we beat every american we c here? stupid.

1,I found that when I saw Asian Americans being attacked daily that I needed something to help decompress at the end of the day. And often it was TV shows. Hopefully others can use this list to do the same #AAPIHeritageMonth

1,I grew up in a predominantly white neighborhood where my Chinese name led to constant othering.  Establishing my handle as @xiaofei_lin was a moment in which I told myself that I'm proud of my identity and I belong here.  Happy #AAPIHeritageMonth!

1,I have been lying awake. For like 4 hours so far. Thinking about the Filipino Genocide that took place from 1899-1902. Somewhere between 200k and a million... It's #AAPIHeritageMonth but this is just... where my brain is while I'm trying to sleep.

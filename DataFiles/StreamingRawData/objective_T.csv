Today is the start of Asian Pacific American Heritage month, and I ask you (everyone not just AAPIs) to do at least one action. It‚Äôs been a tough year for AAPIs. Hear Us, See Us for who we are. I made this #AAPIHeritageMonth guide with ideas to do. Please share. #APAHM (THREAD) https://t.co/x4PrShOixm
AAPI excludes so many different people and continuously uplifts only South East Asians. Asia is big. So is the Pacific.  #AAPIHeritageMonth consistently excludes Indigenous people and their concerns as well.
This #AAPIHeritageMonth let's celebrate but also pay it forward. I'm still helping to fundraise for Baby Tyler in the Philippines. He has cerebral palsy and epilepsy and his family has been hit hard by the pandemic. More details in the link; please, please donate/share üíô

Today is May 1st which means it's Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. It's been very inspiring the last few years to see more &amp; more people of #AAPI descent featured more prominently in movies, TV shows, politics and other public facing roles. #AAPIHeritageMonth
It's #AAPIHeritageMonth! Top of mind this year is solidarity with: - South Asian Americans - Southeast Asian Americans - Undocumented Asians - Native Hawaiians &amp; Pacific Islanders - Other PoC, esp. Black folks. Asians have benefited so much from Black activism &amp; movements.

Hi @pewresearch üôÇ #AAPIHeritageMonth is about recognizing the diversity of Asian America. It's disappointing to see that when people identified their ethnic/national origin as 'Taiwanese', you ignored their answers and wrote in a new one ('Chinese') instead.   h/t @jessicadrun
It's #AAPIHeritageMonth and you know what isn't ok? How diasporic Asians &amp; wider society continue to subsume Pacific Islanders into AA histories &amp; identities &amp; erase Pacific Islanders. What are some must-read books by Pacific Islanders? Some must-see movies by Pacific Islanders?

@HOUmanReporter Highlighting books re "AAPI experience in the US" is certainly one kind of #AAPIHeritageMonth book list &amp; if that's the parameter, then curators should i.d. it as such. (Using that "test," only 1 of my 3 novels could be included, btw!üò±)

This #AAPIHeritageMonth is a big one for me because I‚Äôve been working through a lot of racial identity and antiracism stuff.  For a long time, I hated identifying as Asian American, not because I was ashamed necessarily, but because being labeled and stereotyped as ‚ÄúAsian‚Äù hurt.
When I began unpacking all this in August, I called myself a reluctant Asian American.  Reflecting on this #AAPIHeritageMonth, I no longer feel reluctant. I have always been and continue to be fiercely proud of my roots. Now I can also say I‚Äôm proud to be called #AAPI too.
It's the first week of #AsianHeritageMonth #AAPIHeritageMonth ! Let's kickoff the celebration by giving some love to Jubilee, the Asian American teen firecracker who was literally an obsession for every Asian girl geek I know. We could be heroes, too. Representation MATTERS! https://t.co/7XjnWnkYo9

This #AAPIHeritageMonth is a big one for me because I‚Äôve been working through a lot of racial identity and antiracism stuff.  For a long time, I hated identifying as Asian American, not because I was ashamed necessarily, but because being labeled and stereotyped as ‚ÄúAsian‚Äù hurt.

Part of celebrating #AAPIHeritageMonth is seeing ppl of AAPI descent and AAPI culture as multidimensional. There is beauty but also terrible things abt our cultures. Truly seeing those of us who are AAPI means giving us the grace &amp; privilege of complexity and fallability.

The isolated attacks, mainly by black Americans, have more to do w/ Asian-black relations than government. Think of Ice Cube‚Äôs Black Korea. Not good. Mostly hate incidents, not hate crimes.

@amishshortbus @nytimes it's called unnecessary details. it's a booster rocket. it's not a Chinese rocket. when our booster rockets fell they were just booster rockets. the only reason to to put Chinese on there is to drum up hate. which it turns out we currently have a huge problem with #stopasianhate
